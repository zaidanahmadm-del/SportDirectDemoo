Build a mobile-first Sports Direct microsite with a bold, sporty aesthetic that matches the brand (red/blue/black/white). Use Vite + React + TypeScript and Three.js for a lightweight 3D game. The site has three routes:

/ (Landing & Registration)

/game (3D penalty mini-game)

/win (Congrats + store opening + voucher)

Brand & UI

Color palette: Red #FF0000, Blue #0033CC, Black #111111, White #FFFFFF, Gray #F4F4F4.

Typography: strong sans-serif (e.g., Inter or similar), bold headings, large buttons.

Buttons: bold red bg, white text, rounded-md, full-width on mobile.

Header: Sports Direct logo (use provided logo file /public/sports-direct-logo.png; if not found, create a red/blue text placeholder).

Keep layout minimal and punchy like sportsdirect.com: wide headlines, strong contrast, clean blocks.

Add basic Tailwind CSS for styling.

Tech & Structure

Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Router + Three.js.

Files:

src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx (routing), src/styles.css (Tailwind).

Pages: src/pages/Landing.tsx, src/pages/Game.tsx, src/pages/Win.tsx.

Components: src/components/Header.tsx, src/components/BrandButton.tsx.

Utils: src/utils/voucher.ts, src/utils/storage.ts.

PWA-ready (manifest + icons placeholders).

SEO: title/description, Open Graph tags.

Page 1 — Landing (“/”)

Top: header with Sports Direct logo centered.

Hero copy:

H1: “Kick Off with Sports Direct”

Sub: “Register, score the winning goal, and unlock your opening-day voucher.”

Form fields (stacked, large): Full Name, Email, Phone.

Validation: required fields, email pattern, phone digits.

Start Game button (red, full-width).

On submit:

Save {name,email,phone} to localStorage under sd_user.

Navigate to /game.

Footer note: “By continuing you agree to the event T&Cs.” (link placeholder).

Page 2 — 3D Game (“/game”)

Implement a simple, fun 3D penalty shootout using Three.js (no heavy physics libs). It should run smoothly on mobile.

Scene

PerspectiveCamera, ambient + directional light.

Ground plane (green), stadium-like gradient background (skybox or a big color plane).

Goal made from simple white boxes (crossbar + posts). Add a thin invisible “goal line” plane for scoring detection.

A ball (white sphere with subtle hex pattern or simple white).

The goal moves horizontally left-to-right in front of the camera on a loop (tween with sine easing between two x bounds).

Controls & Play

UI instructions: “Tap to shoot! Keep trying until you score.”

One-tap/click anywhere:

If ball is “ready”, animate a fast forward kick: move the ball along Z axis toward the goal with slight arc (y up a bit).

Add small random spread on each shot so it’s not trivial.

When ball reaches/overlaps the goal line plane within the posts, count as a GOAL. Otherwise, reset ball to starting position after a brief delay so user can try again.

Unlimited tries until user scores.

Minimal sound: soft “kick” and “cheer” (optional, include toggle).

Win Flow

On first GOAL:

Show a full-screen overlay: “GOAL! You’ve unlocked your voucher.” with a confetti canvas (simple particles).

Generate a unique voucher code (see utils below).

Save {won: true, code, time} in localStorage under sd_voucher.

CTA button: “View Your Voucher” → navigate to /win.

Performance

Lock to 60fps when possible, throttle animations on hidden tab, dispose on unmount.

Works great on mobile portrait first; add a small prompt to rotate if landscape.

Page 3 — Win (“/win”)

If sd_voucher.won is not true, redirect to /game.

Header logo, confetti accent.

H1: “Congratulations, {firstName}!” (parse from sd_user.name).

Card:

“You’ve won a Sports Direct voucher.”

Voucher Code in large monospace box (copy-to-clipboard button).

Fine text: “Show this code at our new store opening to redeem.”

Store Opening Details block (editable placeholders):

“Sports Direct — New Store Opening”

Date: Friday, 27 Sept, 10:00 AM

Location: [Mall/Street], City

Launch offers & terms (placeholder list).

Buttons:

“Add to Calendar” (generate ICS file on click).

“Get Directions” (link to Google Maps placeholder).

“Back to Home”.

Voucher & Storage Utils

generateVoucherCode():

Format: SD- + 8-char uppercase base36 (e.g., SD-7K3Q9WPT).

Ensure deterministic per user per day: hash of email + yyyymmdd so refresh doesn’t spam new codes; but if no email, random.

storage.ts helpers for get/set JSON in localStorage with key prefixes.

Extra Requirements

Accessibility: labels tied to inputs, focus states, ARIA where relevant.

Responsive: mobile-first; tablet/desktop get centered narrow layout.

Theming: create Tailwind config for brand colors; headings in blue, CTAs in red, dark text on white cards.

Assets: place /public/sports-direct-logo.png; if missing, render a placeholder logo: stacked “SPORTS” (white text on blue block) over “DIRECT” (white on red block).

No backend: keep all data client-side; include a Download CSV developer link (hidden under a query param ?admin=1) that exports captured sign-ups as CSV from localStorage for demo purposes.

Add a tiny Privacy modal (what’s stored locally, no server).

Clean code, comments on game logic, and clear README with how to run/build.

Finally, generate the project and ensure:

npm run dev serves the three routes correctly.

The 3D game is smooth on mobile and visually matches a Sports Direct vibe.
